# Epic 5 - Payment Methods  
Extend the functionality of the **Pro Language** platform by adding the ability to pay for language courses and subscriptions.

## General Requirements  
Use the existing Angular Front-end: [prolanguage-ui-app](prolanguage-ui-app)  
Integrate with the following [Microservice payment](microservice\publish)

The system should support the following features:  
* Add course to cart.  
* Get courses from cart.  
* Get orders.  
* Get payment methods.  
* Perform payment with the selected method.  

---

### Entities  

#### **Order**  
* **Id:** Guid, required, unique  
* **Date:** DateTime, optional  
* **CustomerId:** Guid, required  
* **Status:** Enum, required  

#### **OrderCourse**  
* **OrderId:** Guid, required  
* **CourseId:** Guid, required  
* **Price:** Double, required  
* **Quantity:** Int, required  
* **Discount:** Int, optional  

Course-Order combinations are unique.  

---

## Additional Requirements  

### Payment  
Create a single endpoint for payment, independent from the selected method.  
If the payment is processed successfully, the order must be marked as **Paid**, otherwise **Cancelled**.  

### Payment Methods  
Allowed payment methods: **“Bank”**, **“IBox terminal”**, **“Visa”**.  
Only one method can be applied to an order for payment.  
Each payment method includes a small image, title, and description.  

### Customer  
Since user registration is still under development, use a stub value for **Customer Id**.  

### Bank Payment Validity  
The **invoice validity date** (how long the invoice is valid) must be configurable via application settings.  

### Order Limitations  
Users cannot order more courses than available (if limited enrollment applies).  

### Order Statuses  
* **Open** – courses are in the cart.  
* **Checkout** – payment is started.  
* **Paid** – payment is performed successfully.  
* **Cancelled** – payment failed.

### Non-functional Requirements
** E05 NFR1 **

A Payment Microservice must run locally and integrate with the Pro Language API for Visa and IBox payments.
Swagger endpoint should be used to test and validate requests.

** E05 NFR2 **

Implement fault-tolerant payment acceptance.
As the microservice may reject up to 10% of transactions, add response validation and automatic retry on failure.
Ensure compatibility with all microservice responses.
